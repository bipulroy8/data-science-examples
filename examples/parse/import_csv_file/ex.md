This example shows a very simple example of how to parse a small CSV file.

The well-known iris dataset is used.

The H2O examples use the h2o.importFile method, which is a "pull-into-h2o" operation.

This is a fast, scalable, highly optimized way to read data.  H2O pulls the data from a data store.  H2O initiates the data transfer as a read operation.
